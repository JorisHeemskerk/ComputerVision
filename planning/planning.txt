=============== MoSCoW ===============

Must have:
- A way to decide wich letter is in a given image.
- Shape Contexts as a feature to recognise letters.
- Documented experiments.
- Documented results and conclusion.

Should have:
- Scale Invariant Feature Transform as a feature to recognise letters.

Could have:
- Maximum Response of filters as a feature to recognise letters.

Wont Have:
- Any simelaritys between my work and Rick Horemans work (same challenge).


============== Planning ==============

Week 1:
- Deciding upon paper.
- Establishing github page.

Week 2:
- Diving into paper.
- Deciding MoSCoW.
- 1st itteration of this planning.

Week 3:
- Extensive research into Shape Contexts.
- Setting up workspace
- Start implementing format for algorithm (reading files and allowing space to manipulate them).
- Potentially revisit planning.

Week 4:
- Implementation of Shape Contexts.
- Document experiments and results.
- Potentially revisit planning.

Week 5:
